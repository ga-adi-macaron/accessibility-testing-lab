Things to change on TO DO LIST:

Title text reads as “get I T done”. Add a content description so it pronounces it correctly.

Alert dialog edit-text shouldn’t read the text decoration asterisks. And the NVM might want to read as never mind.

Alert to add item to list has too many textviews/edittexts to be concise. Going to set the titles to the edit text to be not important for accessibility, then make the edit text hints more descriptive.

Destroy? is vague. Add better description.
