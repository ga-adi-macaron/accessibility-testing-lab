This lab is focused on making sure your apps follow accessibility guidelines. You will analyze your project 1 app, identify any accessibility issues, and fix those gaps. Use the skills you learned in the lesson to determine what needs to change in your app.

## Exercise

#### Requirements  

* Identify and list accessibility changes that need to be made
* Fix the issues you identified in your project 1 code

#### Deliverable

- A document containing the identified issues
- An improved version of your app that meets accessibility guidelines.


11-8: UPDATING FOR ACCESSIBIITY LAB

[B]Errors/issues I'm seeing[/B] - the Scanner app is mainly indicating that I have redundant entries (eg. the same name for multiple list items or views). Other than that, the only real "issues" it's giving me is with the size of my views, which are all standard Android dimensions. 

        If I can figure out how to have the contentDescription read out the information the user places into an EditText, instead of the description I'm giving it, I think it would go a long way towards me being able to have an app that is fully compliant with accessibility standards.
