Home Activity:
added content description to the recycler view.
added content description to the floating action button.


ToDoList Activity:
added content description to the recycler view.
added content description to the floating action button.

Add List Item Dialog Box:
gave the priority radio buttons a content description

Edit List Item Dialog Box:
gave the priority radio buttons a content description

ToDoList Activity Recycler Item:
added content description to the checkbox
added content description to the edit item button

when an item is selected, an edit item button pops up. I added the same onclicklistener to the item itself once it has already been clicked once.
This way, the user can edit the item without having to race the pop-up button that disappears after only a few seconds.
